# Syndesis Quickstarts

<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="img//syndesis.png">Syndesis makes Camel super easy to use. It packages Camel components as `Connectors` with a described dataInput and dataOutput shape. This is makes building an integration as easy as clicking Duplos together. Each of our QuickStarts have a little video to see help you build your own integration, plus there is an export file you can use to import to load up the entire scenario. Note that you might have to update things like credentials. 

Have fun playing!

## 1. Introduction to Syndesis

Syndesis is a cloud native application targeted at systems integration. It leverages Apache Camel, and adds a UI layer that helps developers, and more importantly the more technically business analysist, to create integrations without writing any code. Integrations are deployed as Spring Boot applications inside a container onto OpenShift. 

The easiest way to try Syndesis is to use a trial of the product called Fuse Online. You can sign up at [fuse-online](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/fuse-online), and skip right to the [QuickStart](#lets-run-some-quickstarts) section.
However if youâ€™re like me and you want to be able try things out by running it locally, you probably want to run the Syndesis project bits. This is where this blog is about. I will take you through to the few straightforward steps to
  * [Install openshift using oc cluster up](README.md#2-install-openshift-using-oc-cluster-up)
  * [Install Syndesis on Openshift](README.md#3-install-syndesis)
  * [Run some QuickStarts](README.md#4-lets-run-some-quickstarts)

## 2. Install openshift using oc cluster up
Follow instructions given in the below URL to install Openshift on Centos7 machine. Use packet host(z1.samll.x86) hosted in Dallas, Texas. Provide cluster-admin privileges to developer user.

## 3. Install Syndesis
```
# Clone the Syndesis repository
$ git clone https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis.git

# Set path to include Syndesis' tool directory
$ export PATH=${PATH}:$(pwd)/syndesis/tools/bin

# Alternatively, set a symbolic link to "syndesis"
$ ln -s $(pwd)/syndesis/tools/bin/syndesis /usr/local/bin

 $ syndesis install --setup
 
 $ syndesis install
```


## 4. Let's run some QuickStarts

Syndesis lets you build application without writing any code. Perhaps the easiest way to learn about Syndesis is to simply run to quickstarts. The quickstarts are zero code, so instead we offer Syndesis integration `exports` from scenarios we built for you. You can try them out by `importing` an export as an integration into Syndesis. After the import you sometimes may need to re-enter some connection information like passwords. The accompanying README should detail this. We have ordered the Quickstarts loosely ordered by simplicity, so it is recommended to start from the top of this list. 

### 4.1 Integrations
  * [Hello World](hello-world) - log 'Hello World!'
  * [DB 2 DB](db-2-db) - read from a database table, insert in another database table
  * [FHIR 2 FHIR](fhir) - breath 'fire' from a FHIR REST service and update the same record
  * [DB 2 API Connector](db-2-api-connector) - create a Custom RESTful Connector to the Todo REST API
  * [Twitter 2 DB](twitter-2-db) - search twitter and push matches to a database
  * [Twitter 2 GMail](twitter-2-gmail) - search twitter and send out matches in the body of an email
  * [Kafka 2 DB](kafka-2-db) - setup a Kafka Broker, then listen to a Kafka Topic and write to a database
  * [Jira 2 Twitter](jira-2-twitter) - retrieve Jira comments and send them as Twitter direct messages
  * [DB 2 GoogleSheets](db-2-googlesheets) - read from a database, insert into googlesheet.
  
### 4.2 API
  * [WebHook](webhook-2-db) - create and expose a webhook to invoke an integration with some data
  * [API Provider](api-provider) - create and expose a REST interface to (remotely) interact with integration flows
  * [Syndesis API](public-api) - Syndesis has a public API you can use to integrate Syndesis with your systems

### 4.3 Acquire OAuth Credentials for the Syndesis Setting Section
  * [Twitter](twitter-2-db/TwitterCredentials.md)
  * [GMail](twitter-2-gmail/GmailCredentials.md)
  * [GoogleSheets API](db-2-googlesheets/GoogleSheetsCredentials.md)
  * [Jira](jira-2-twitter/JiraConnection.md)
